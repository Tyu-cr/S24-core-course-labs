```

### Best Practices

- **_Modularization_**: Organize Terraform configurations into reusable modules to promote code reuse and
  maintainability.
- **_Version Control_**: Keep Terraform configurations in version control
- **_Secure Management_**: Utilize environment variables to store sensitive information
