## Framework

For this lab I chose FastAPI as the framework for several reasons:

1. **_Performance:_** FastAPI is renowned for its exceptional performance.
   Also, it is built on top of Starlette and Pydantic.
2. **_Asynchronous Support:_**  FastAPI fully supports asynchronous programming, which is beneficial for I/O-bound
   operations such as network requests and database queries.
3. **_Modern Features:_** FastAPI leverages Python 3.7+ type hints and pydantic models. These features facilitate
   automatic data validation, serialization, and documentation generation.
4. **_Easy to use_**: FastAPI has a clean and intuitive syntax, making it easy to learn and use. In addition, I already
   have some experience using this framework.

## Best practices
- **_Error Handling:_** Error handling in the application is implemented so it can catch exceptions.
- **_PEP 8 Compliance:_** The code follows the PEP 8 style guide for Python code.
- **_Manual Testing:_** I manually tested the application on my local machine.
